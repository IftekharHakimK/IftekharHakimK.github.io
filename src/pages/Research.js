                    <Typography.Paragraph style={{ fontSize: '12px' }}>In this work, we drew an efficient solution to find matching locations between parameterized text and pattern with fixed mismatch
                        tolerance. Two solutions have been introduced â€“ one for unit tolerance value, one for the generic case. For the first one, we
                        solved it by using Segment Tree data structure, hashing and some insightful observations for transformation of string. For
                        the later, we improved previously known matching solution by incorporating Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our solution
                        is also parallelizable on multi-core machine and does not depend on value of tolerance.</Typography.Paragraph>
